            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p><b>Research Areas</b></p>
            <p>I am best described as a communication scientist drawing from approaches in political science, sociology, and media studies.
            </p>
            <p>My empirical and conceptual research broadly looks at implications of a changing news and information environment for democratic discourse and the functioning of democracy.</p> 
            <p>My first major area of interest within this (with various co-authors) is how artificial intelligence reshapes the mechanisms of news production and distribution, and with what effects for publishers, audiences, and the structure of the public arena.</p>
            <p>A second major area is what I term the developing political economy of AI and news: the role major technology companies play in the development, deployment, and provision of AI on communication infrastructures.
            <p><b>Collaborators</b></p>
            <p>
            One of the joys of academic work is collaborating with others. I have had the great luck of working with a number of wonderful scholars, journalists, and other practitioners listed here alphabetically (if I missed you, please reach out. Ongoing collaborations are not yet included):
