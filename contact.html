            <h3>Contact</h3>
            <p>If you want to or need to contact me, you will probably fall into one of the following categories: academic interested in collaborating, journalist who wants to talk, client who wants to hire me; critic who wants to tell me where I am wrong (more often than not I am probably wrong), student who wants advice, or curious individual who simply wants to learn more about my work and perspectives. In any case, I welcome all forms of engagement and am always open to a good conversation.</p>
            <p>
            The easiest way to reach me is by email: <a href="mailto:felix.simon@politics.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">felix.simon@politics.ox.ac.uk</a>. I strive to reply to all emails as soon as possible but cannot always promise a speedy response.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can also send me a DM on <a href="https://x.com/_FelixSimon_" target="_blank">Twitter/X</a>,   <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/felixsimon.bsky.social" target="_blank">BlueSky<a/>, or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixsimon/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and follow me on both for my musings if you are so inclined.
            </p>

            If you are a fan of pen and paper, please write a letter to:
