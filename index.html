                <p>Hello! I am Dr Felix M. Simon, a (political) communication researcher and the Research Fellow in AI, Information, and News at the <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/people/felix-simon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism</a> within the Department of Politics at Oxford University. I am also a Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/felix-simon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxford Internet Institute</a> and a Junior Research Fellow in Politics at <a href="https://www.ccc.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-felix-m-simon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corpus Christi College</a>, both at Oxford University. I research the implications of AI for information, news, and democracy. In a past life, I used to be a journalist.</p>
                <p>My research broadly seeks to understand the structural implications of AI, including forms of generative AI, for the production, distribution, and consumption of information and news and the effects of AI on our information ecosystem (and by extension our societies). A special focus of my work is the role of technology and platform companies in this context – what I call the political economy of AI and news and information. I am also interested in (and have worked on) various topics around political communication in the digital age, especially the future of mis- and disinformation and questions of epistemic security as well as the changing nature of journalism and the media in the 21st century.</p>
                <p>In June 2024, I completed my PhD with no corrections at the University of Oxford’s Oxford Internet Institute under the supervision of Ralph Schroeder, Ekaterina Hertog and Gina Neff. I was a Knight News Innovation Fellow at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism (2021-2024) where I remain an affiliate. I am a Faculty Associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Public Tech Media Lab, an affiliate at the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a fellow at the Salzburg Global Seminar and an Associate Fellow of the UK Higher Education Academy. I regularly write and comment on technology, media, and politics for various international outlets, including as a regular columnist for NIKKEI.</p>
                <p>This (admittedly very basic) website provides an overview of my research interests (too many), publications (some more interesting than others) and media coverage and commentary (mostly as a way for me to keep track). If you are interested in my background or need a bio for me, please refer to the eponymous section. If you want to hire me for consulting work or as an expert, as a keynote speaker or similar, please check the consulting tab. If you have a press request or want to talk to me, please see the contact section or reach out via one of the sites below.</p>
