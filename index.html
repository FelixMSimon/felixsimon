                <p>I am a communication researcher and research fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University where I research the implications of AI for the news, journalism and the public sphere. In a past life, I used to be a journalist.</p>
                <p>I completed my PhD at the Oxford Internet Institute and was a Knight News Innovation Fellow at Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism (2021-2024) where I remain an affiliate. I am an affiliate at the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I regularly write and comment on technology, media, and politics for various international outlets.</p>
                <p>My research broadly seeks to understand the structural implications of AI, including forms of generative AI, for the production, distribution, and consumption of news and the effects of AI on our information ecosystem. A special focus of my work is the role of technology and platform companies in this context â€“ what I call the political economy of AI and news. I am also interested in (and have worked on) various topics around political communication in the digital age, especially the future of mis- and disinformation, big data in politics and the entertainment industry, as well as the changing nature of journalism and the media in the 21st century.</p>
                <p>This website provides an overview of my research interests (too many), publications (some more interesting than others) and media coverage and commentary (mostly as a way for me to keep track). If you are interested in my background or need a bio for me, please refer to the eponymous section. If you want to hire me for consulting work, as a speaker or similar, please check the consulting tab. If you have a press request or want to talk to me, please see the contact section or below.</p>
