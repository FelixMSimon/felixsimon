                <p>I am a communication researcher and research fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University where I research the implications of AI for the news, journalism and the public sphere. In a past life, I used to be a journalist.<p> 
                <p>I completed my PhD at the Oxford Internet Institute and was a Knight News Innovation Fellow at Columbia Universityâ€™s Tow Center for Digital Journalism ('21-'24). I am an affiliate at the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I regularly write and comment on technology, media, and politics for various international outlets.<p>
                <p>My research seeks to understand the structural implications of AI, including forms of generative AI, for the production and distribution of news and the public sphere. A special focus of my work is the role of technology and platform companies in this context. I am also interested in (and have worked) on political communication in the digital age, especially the future of mis- and disinformation, big data in politics and the entertainment industry, as well as the changing nature of journalism and the media in the 21st century.</p>
