            <h3>Consulting</h3>
            <p>I provide consulting services around the following topics:</p> 
            <p>1) Strategic overview of the AI landscape as it relates to news and journalism, based on the latest academic and industry evidence</p>
            <p>2) Help in dissecting news industry trends and their ramifications, including but not limited to AI</p>
            <p>3) Workshops on questions of AI risks and benefits and adoption, especially with a view towards broader AI strategy, AI ethics, and relationships with technology companies</p>
            <p>I also offer bespoke consultations on any of the topics I work on as required and requested.
            
            <h3>Public Speaking</h3>
            <p>I have plenty of experience as moderator, keynote speaker and panellist at industry, academic, and public events and have hosted public panels and given talks and keynotes at various international institutions and for various clients (in both English and German), including the University of Oxford, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, Aspen Digital, Thomson Reuters, Axel Springer, the Online News Association, the MacArthur Foundation, the Nordica AI in Media Summit, and the International Journalism Festival (full list available on request).</p>
            <p>If you would like to book me for any of the above, please do reach out by email to enquire for references and rates or pro-bono work (I am usually happy to speak for very little or free for charity).</p>
